# Sparkify Analytics 

This project implements data analytics solution for Sparkify using the data generated by the userâ€™s interaction with the application.
This solution will provide the capability to analyze this data from several perspectives like usage and content trends. Therefore will help to improve the application and to provides better content to end users.

The solution is based on a star schema, which is database model specifical for analytical purposes. It is based on the next Fact and dimension tables implemented in PostgreSQL:

### Fact Table

<ul>
    <li>songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong</li>
</ul>


### Dimension Tables
<ul>
 <li>users - users in the app </li>
 <li>songs - songs in music database </li>
 <li>artists - artists in music database </li>
 <li>time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units </li>
</ul>

Also has been implemented a ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into the database.  

Some sample of data analysis implemented with this solution are:

### top 10 artists and songs

%sql SELECT T3.NAME AS ARTIST, T2.TITLE AS SONG, COUNT(T1.SONG_ID) AS TOTAL \
FROM SONGPLAYS T1 JOIN SONGS T2 ON T1.SONG_ID = T2.SONG_ID \
JOIN ARTISTS AS T3 ON T2.ARTIST_ID = T3.ARTIST_ID \
GROUP BY T3.NAME, T2.TITLE \
ORDER BY TOTAL DESC \
LIMIT 10


### the total plays by week

%sql SELECT  T2.YEAR, T2.MONTH, T2.WEEK, COUNT(T1.SONGPLAY_ID) AS TOTAL_PLAYS \
FROM SONGPLAYS T1 \
JOIN TIME T2 ON T1.START_TIME = T2.START_TIME \
GROUP BY T2.YEAR, T2.MONTH, T2.WEEK \
ORDER BY T2.YEAR, T2.MONTH, T2.WEEK



### total users by level

%sql SELECT T1.LEVEL, COUNT(T1.USER_ID) AS TOTAL \
FROM USERS T1 \
GROUP BY T1.LEVEL
